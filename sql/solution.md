# Solution

In this solution, we will create an SQL query to fetch location information (submarket, market, state, and region) based on the provided latitude and longitude coordinates. The query is divided into three parts (cases), each handling a different scenario.

First, let's create the necessary tables to store information about regions, states, markets, submarkets, and their relationships.

```sql
CREATE TABLE regions (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE states (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    abbreviation CHAR(2) NOT NULL,
    region_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (region_id) REFERENCES regions(id)
);

CREATE TABLE markets (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    region_id INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (region_id) REFERENCES regions(id)
);

CREATE TABLE submarkets (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    market_id INT NOT NULL,
    polygon TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (market_id) REFERENCES markets(id)
);
```
Now, we will create a query that returns the submarket, market, state, and region based on the provided latitude and longitude coordinates.

```sql
-- Case 1: Point within a submarket polygon
SELECT 
    sm.name AS submarket,
    m.name AS market,
    s.abbreviation AS state,
    r.name AS region
FROM 
    submarkets sm
JOIN 
    markets m ON sm.market_id = m.id
JOIN 
    regions r ON m.region_id = r.id
JOIN 
    states s ON r.id = s.region_id
WHERE 
    ST_Within(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326), ST_GeomFromText(sm.polygon, 4326))

UNION ALL

-- Case 2: Point in a state with a region but not in any submarket polygon
SELECT 
    'Other' AS submarket,
    'Other' AS market,
    s.abbreviation AS state,
    r.name AS region
FROM 
    states s
JOIN 
    regions r ON s.region_id = r.id
WHERE 
    s.abbreviation NOT IN (
        SELECT s.abbreviation
        FROM submarkets sm
        JOIN markets m ON sm.market_id = m.id
        JOIN regions r ON m.region_id = r.id
        JOIN states s ON r.id = s.region_id
        WHERE ST_Within(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326), ST_GeomFromText(sm.polygon, 4326))
    )
    AND ST_Within(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326), ST_GeomFromText(s.boundary_polygon, 4326))

UNION ALL

-- Case 3: Point in a state without a region
SELECT 
    s.abbreviation AS submarket,
    s.abbreviation AS market,
    s.abbreviation AS state,
    s.abbreviation AS region
FROM 
    states s
WHERE 
    s.region_id IS NULL
    AND ST_Within(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326), ST_GeomFromText(s.boundary_polygon, 4326))

LIMIT 1
```

This query is designed to find location information (submarket, market, state, and region) based on the provided latitude and longitude coordinates. The query is divided into three parts (cases), each handling a different scenario. The UNION ALL operator is used to combine the results from these three parts, and LIMIT 1 at the end ensures only one row is returned as a result.

1. Case 1: Point within a submarket polygon
This part of the query checks if the given coordinates fall within any submarket polygon. If they do, it returns the submarket, market, state, and region associated with that polygon.
2. Case 2: Point in a state with a region but not in any submarket polygon
If the coordinates do not fall within any submarket polygon, this part of the query checks if they are within a state that has a region. If they are, it returns 'Other' as the submarket and market, the state abbreviation, and the associated region name. The 'Other' value indicates that the point belongs to a region but not to any specific market or submarket.
3. Case 3: Point in a state without a region
Finally, if the coordinates do not fall within any submarket polygon and are not in a state with a region, this part of the query checks if they are within a state that doesn't have a region. If they are, it returns the state abbreviation for submarket, market, state, and region. This means the point is located in a state without a region, and no further location information is available.


If the product team initially provides only the market polygons instead of submarket polygons, the "polygon" column in the "submarkets" table should be replaced with a "market_id" column. The "markets" table will then have a "polygon" column. The query should be modified accordingly to use the market polygon in the ST_Within function for market and submarket determination. The rest of the database structure remains unchanged.
